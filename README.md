### Hi there! I'm TheCerealist!
## I make software for people to use to bypass restrictions.
## I am not responsible for any trouble you get up to via my services.
#### But enough about me. Why are you here? Maybe you wanted a proxy, maybe you wanted a custom Minecraft/Eaglercraft plugin?
#### Ayways, I make websites and crap like that.
#### I taught myself through trial and error, and a *lot* of Stackoverflow.
#### If you want to see something, then stop reading this and check my repositories.
